# digit_recognition_opencv
Digit Recognition using OpenCV and Keras in Python with detailed description for beginner

<h3> Step 1 - Installing the required Libraries </h3>
<p>I have used Anaconda Spyder IDE for this project. Install the following libraries into your machine using Anaconda Command Prompt.</p>

<p>pip install opencv-python <br>
pip install tensorflow <br>
pip install keras</p>

<h3> Step 2 - Run model_build.py file </h3>
<p>This file creates model using <b>CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)</b>. Accuary is <b>99.86%</b>.I have worked with 30 epochs and 90 batch_size. It took approx. 1 hour for me to fit the model. You can always change the values to experiment with the accuracy of the model. At the end, I have converted serialize the model and converted into JSON format for easier access.</p>
